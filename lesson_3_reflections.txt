When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If you wanted to backup your local code and/or you were collaborating with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you weren't ready for your changes to be made public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks is only for cloning on GitHub. Cloning allows for working on a copy of a codebase. 
Branches allow for working on different versions of a program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can start working right away and be assured you are working with the latest copy of the code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Using Google Doc. It would be much harder to back out and merge changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Making changes in a separate branch allows changes to be isolated, modularized, and the code to be worked on 
in parallel.  But it is certainly a more complicated workflow process than just focusing on one program.
