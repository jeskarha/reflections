How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It highlighted the lines that were different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You could easily return to a working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You know when your changes are done.  You don't have versions wih non-meaningful changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Bigger projects will likely require multiple files to change to work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives the commit id and git diff gives the changes between two commits.  The format is git diff firstCommitId secondCommitId

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You know you can always go back to the working version before your changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

TensorFlow project code!!
